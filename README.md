How it works
Welcome to the 100 Days of Swift! This is a free collection of videos, tutorials, tests, and more, all drawn from around my existing work here on Hacking with Swift, and all designed to help you learn Swift.

It’s aimed squarely at beginners who want to learn to build real iOS apps, but struggle to find a good, free course that can help them achieve their goals. If that’s you, welcome – I hope you’re ready to show the iOS world what you’re made of!

Important: There are two versions of the 100 Days course, this one and the newer 100 Days of SwiftUI. If you don’t know which one to follow, let me tell you up front: you should follow the 100 Days of SwiftUI. You should only follow this original version of the course if you specifically want to learn Apple’s older UIKit framework.

 

Rules
If you want to make a success of this course, there are only two rules:

Every day you spend one hour reading or watching Swift tutorials, or writing Swift code.
Every day you post about your progress to the social media site of your choosing. Tell people!
I’ll be providing all the material you need to follow along, so all you need to do is show up ready to learn.

 

Tips
I’ve met so many who have tried and failed to learn Swift, often multiple times, and if you’re here there’s a good chance you’ve already had a few false starts already.

Not this time. This time you’re going to learn it for real, and in just 100 days you’ll have built several full apps that you can be proud of.

You’ve already read the two rules of these 100 days, but to maximize your chance of rocking this course I have a few tips:

It’s a marathon, not a sprint. Don’t charge ahead thinking you’re “learning faster”, because there’s a high chance you’ll get lost. Take your time!
Don’t fall prey to shiny object syndrome. The lure of spending $50 on another course is high, I know, but you don’t learn anything by buying books. Your best chance of success is sticking with the 100 days shown here and really make it work.
Don’t lone wolf it. You aren’t learning by yourself – I’m here to help as are many others. If you have questions, tweet me at @twostraws and I’ll do my best to help!
Use the consolidation days. These are spaced throughout the 100 days to give you time to review what you’ve learned and make it really sink in. Use them to go back over days you weren’t sure about, complete any homework you missed, or just do some free coding.
I have a glossary of common Swift terms that you should bookmark for easy reference.
Download my Unwrap app from the App Store. It works on iPhone and iPad, contains the first 12 days of this course plus lots of bonus activities, and is free with no in-app purchases.
